# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction
The task is to understand the concept of Customer Lifetime Value and provide a data-driven solution through data methodologies.To understand customer behaviour and to find out the profitable customers and predict the lifetime valuation of a customer to facilitate target marketing. CLV is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of their relationship. Itâ€™s an important metric as it costs less to keep existing customers than it does to acquire new ones, so increasing the value of your existing customers is a great way to drive growth.

We have used R programming for carrying out the project. The results are presented with the help of `R markdown`.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pankajjsh06/ibm-watson-marketing-customer-value-data). The features and their descriptions are provided in `Marketing CLV Analysis - Data Dictionary.pdf`. The dataset contains 23 features and the target variable - *Customer Lifetime Value*. The dataset doesn't have any missing values.

## Workflow
The aim is to understand customer demographic, buying behaviour and to model customer lifetime value. The steps taken are listed below:
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Statistical tests to understand the influence of different categorical variables on the response variable.The code used to perform the tests are provided in `Kruskal_wallace_tests.Rmd` and the final results are summarised in `Kruskal_wallace_tests.pdf`.
* Data transformation and Feature extraction.
* Building Machine learning models. We have explored different models to arrive at the best model - Stepwise linear regression, polynimial regression, Ridge and lasso regression, XGBoost.
* Based on the performance of the models and the feature selection results, a final linear regression model was selected as the final model.
* Suggestions for better customer targeting.

The code used for the entire process is available in `CLV_Report.Rmd` and the results are summarised in the form of a final report which is provided in `CLV_Report.pdf` and `CLV_Report.html`.
